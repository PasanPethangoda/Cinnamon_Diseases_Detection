      "brief": "Stripe Canker disease in cinnamon plants, primarily caused by the fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi or Cylindrocladium scoparium, poses a severe threat to their health and yield. This disease manifests as dark, elongated cankers on the stems and branches, which can girdle and eventually kill the affected parts of the plant.
